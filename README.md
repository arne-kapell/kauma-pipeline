# KAuMA Pipeline
Reusable GitHub workflow for KAuMA projects at DHBW Mannheim.

## Usage
You just have to copy the [example workflow](example.yml) into the `.github/workflows` directory of your project and adjust the sections `with` and `env` to your needs. (Triggers can be adjusted as well, but the example should be fine for most projects.)
